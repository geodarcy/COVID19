COVID notes

find date range
- cut data at three months

word vectors
- transit
- bike/ped
- access to essential servies
- personal effect of COVID
- stay home
- public space

Next steps
- create representative list of words for word vectors
- send out spreadsheet of top 500
- classify top 500 words using Manish's method
- join all classifications and send out
- create topic word lists
- send list of five topics for approval
- score tweets
- send out representative tweets
- probably zone of influence is 500 sqkm
- look for commonality of tweets
- check similar words to load and flow and docked

- check Moran's I for different times; i.e. split by months
-- or plot curbside sentiment vs. time

- section 5.1
- NY, Toronto, San Fran, Vancouver
-- maps of April, May, June
-- temporal plots - Moran's I for Toronto and NY by month - Figure 6 (send to Manish)

- split 5.2 into 3 sections for 3 concepts
-- link back to intro
-- limit to 3-5 tweets for quotes

Paper
- little work in introduction
- little work in 2.3
- all of 3 - similar to Irma paper
- all of 4 - similar to Irma paper
- if too much, put parts of 3 and 4 in appendix
- "the flexibility of the street"

- send Figures 3 and 5 reorganized

** next steps **
- only use 1 April to 1 July
- check numbers of tweets overall and in just 8 cities

** read top 500 tweets
- code for topics identified by Manish
-- topics are a contest of space

Revisions
- Manish will put together policy document
-- look for major policy themes
--- also look for cross-cutting themes (eg. slow streets + opening sidewalk dining)
- check "grounded theory" method
-- theory comes from data
-- try LDA to find topics
-> output top 500 tweets for each of three topics
--- Manish e-mailing words for vectors
-> looks at reviews and some more tweets to get a sense paper is on track

Competition for space
- multiple uses for curbspace
- a fifth category
-- social distancing without a lot of more extra info
-- restaurants saying they have more space for social distancing

** test vector model **
- find word vector list to find four topics:
-- cycling
--- ['cycling', 'bike', 'curbside', 'sidewalk']
-- driving/parking
--- ['parking', 'car', 'space']
-- walking
--- ['walking', 'sidewalk']
-- business expansion
--- patios, tents, tables, outdoor seating, curbside pickup, dining
--- ['restaurant', 'patio', 'outdoor', 'seating', 'dining']
